# Truss-Fix
Character must reset for changes to take effect (if you are going to make this a toggle like places such as Eternal Towers of Hell)

## Directions
Option 1: Create a LocalScript in your Roblox Studio Explorer under StarterPlayer -> StarterCharacterScripts and paste the code from "source.lua" into the editor

Option 2: Download and drag the "TrussFix.rbxm" file into Roblox Studio and drag the LocalScript (usually inserted into the Workspace) into StarterPlayer -> StarterCharacterScripts

## Information
Temporarily disables specific states in order to correct glitchiness and flinging caused by jumping off of trusses and ladders (or anything climbable really) when FPS values exceed 60
